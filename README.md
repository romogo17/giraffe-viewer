## Building from Source

### Requirements

- Git
- Yarn
- Node

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the source code from the [imaginglab website](http://imaginglab.una.ac.cr/index.php/p051116-menu/2-uncategorised/27-p051116-p3)
2. Navigate to the repository directory and execute the following command

```bash
yarn
```

> If you wish to run the app on development mode execute `yarn start` in one terminal to start the React Development server and `yarn electron` to run the Electron application.

3. Execute the following command to package the application

```bash
yarn build
```

> In Windows, sometimes the build fails due to an error in some symlinks generated by Yarn. If that's the case, execute the following Powershell command in the project directory
>
> ```bash
> get-childitem -directory -path node_modules/*/* -filter ".bin"  -recurse -EA SilentlyContinue | where FullName -NotLike "*\node_modules\.bin" | % { cmd /c rmdir /s /q $_.FullName }
> ```

4. If the process succeeds there should be a directory named **dist** with the corresponding built application
